<h3>1965 Chevy Truck</h3>
<p>
  Chevrolet abandoned 1950s styling in a big way in 1960, when it introduced the C/K series pickup trucks. The 1960 to 1965 models were leaner, more sculpted, roomier and offered more power than the previous generation. The C/K series styling was so popular that the basic design remained through the end of its production run in 1997. By 1963, one out of every three pickups was a Chevy. In 1963 alone, 483,119 Chevy trucks left the factory.

  The original engine on the Chevy C10 was a 230 cubic-inch six cylinder, which could reach 165 horsepower. Standard factory-installed features for the Chevy C10 included four-way flashing lights, self-canceling turn signals and tilt steering. Air conditioning and an AM radio were also standard for this truck. The seats were bucket-style and the interior colors included black and tan.

  On the 1965 Chevy C10, the wheels were painted the same color as the truck's body. Wheels also featured dog-dish hubcaps and whitewall trim. Stainless steel bed rail and windshield trim added bits of flash to the exterior. Because of rust over time, the body is often partially or fully restored by C10 enthusiasts. Exterior factory colors included sky blue, cream and white. White bumpers and grille paint were standard, and are often modified with chrome parts.
